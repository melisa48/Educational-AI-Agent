# Educational AI Agent
Educational AI Agent is an intelligent tutoring system that provides personalized learning experiences through adaptive content delivery, learning style assessment, and performance tracking. The system supports multiple subjects, adapts difficulty levels based on student performance, and provides tailored recommendations to enhance learning outcomes.

## Features

### Student Profile Management
- Create and maintain individual student profiles
- Track performance history and learning progress
- Record quiz attempts and activity timestamps

### Learning Style Assessment
- Evaluate student learning preferences (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- Tailor explanations and content delivery based on learning style
- Provide personalized recommendations that match learning preferences

### Adaptive Quiz Generation and Evaluation
- Generate quizzes based on the subject and the student's current level
- Evaluate responses with detailed feedback
- Automatically adjust difficulty levels based on performance
- Track mastery of topics and subjects

### Progress Tracking and Analysis
- Calculate average scores per subject
- Analyze performance trends over time
- Generate personalized recommendations based on progress data
- Identify strengths and areas needing improvement

## Supported Subjects
- Mathematics
- Physics
- Chemistry

Each subject contains questions at three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).

## Usage

### Basic Setup
```python
from educational_ai_agent import EducationalAIAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = EducationalAIAgent()

# Create student profiles
agent.create_student_profile('student_id', 'Student Name')
```

### Learning Style Assessment
```python
# Assess student learning style
learning_style_quiz_responses = [
    {'preference': 'diagrams'},
    {'preference': 'verbal_explanation'},
    {'preference': 'hands_on'}
]
learning_style = agent.assess_learning_style('student_id', learning_style_quiz_responses)
print(f"Learning Style: {learning_style}")
```

### Quiz Generation and Evaluation
```python
# Generate a quiz for a specific subject
quiz = agent.generate_quiz('student_id', 'math')
for i, question in enumerate(quiz):
    print(f"Question {i+1}: {question['question']}")

# Evaluate student answers
student_answers = [12, 7]  # Example answers
quiz_results = agent.evaluate_quiz('student_id', 'math', student_answers)
print(f"Score: {quiz_results['score']}%")
```

### Progress Tracking
```python
# Get a comprehensive progress report
progress_report = agent.track_progress('student_id')
print(f"Learning Style: {progress_report['learning_style']}")
print(f"Current Levels: {progress_report['current_levels']}")
print(f"Topics Mastered: {progress_report['topics_mastered']}")
```

## System Intelligence

The Educational AI Agent demonstrates adaptive intelligence through:

1. **Personalization**: Content difficulty adjusts based on performance
2. **Learning Style Adaptation**: Explanations match student's preferred learning method
3. **Progress Analysis**: Identifies trends and makes targeted recommendations
4. **Feedback Specificity**: Provides detailed, contextual feedback for each question

## Educational Design Principles

The system implements several effective educational design principles:

1. **Adaptive Learning**: Content difficulty adjusts to student performance
2. **Personalized Feedback**: Explanations tailored to each student
3. **Mastery-Based Progression**: Students advance when demonstrating proficiency
4. **Learning Style Recognition**: Different explanation styles for different learners
5. **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Suggestions based on performance analytics

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies required

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional subjects
- More sophisticated learning style assessment
- Integration with external content sources
- API for integration with learning management systems
- Expanded analytics and reporting capabilities
